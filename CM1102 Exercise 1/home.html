			This site is a graded assignment for CM1102. The task requires to make a site based on a historical person that has a huge impact on the field of computer science. I've decided to pick Grace Hopper, since in my opinion her work is viable in today's society even after its debut over 58 years ago. I hope you enjoy this site and possibly learn something new from it.

		<h2>Base Information</h2>
		<p>
			Grace Brewster Murray Hopper was an American computer scientist and United States Navy rear admiral. One of the first programmers of the Harvard Mark I computer, she was a pioneer of computer programming who invented one of the first compiler related tools. She popularized the idea of machine-independent programming languages, which led to the development of COBOL, an early high-level programming language still in use today.
