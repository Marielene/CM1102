		<h2>Conclusion</h2>
		<p> 
			Grace Hopper has changed not only the world of computing, but she also paved the way for women in the military and mathematics. Her invention of the first complier changed fundamentally the way we code. The idea of separating code and implementation has brought a new era in digital development. 58 years after its debut COBOL still is the programming language with most lines of code in the world, the extraordinary number of 220 BILLION. The US Navy, aviocompany databases and other strategic objectives still use COBOL to this day. One could say her and her team have laid out the fundamentals on which the American digitalization stands today.

			Owing to her accomplishments and her naval rank, she was sometimes referred to as "Amazing Grace". The U.S. Navy Arleigh Burke-class guided-missile destroyer USS Hopper was named for her, as was the Cray XE6 "Hopper" supercomputer at NERSC. During her lifetime, Hopper was awarded 40 honorary degrees from universities across the world. A college at Yale University is named in her honor. In 1991, she received the National Medal of Technology. On November 22, 2016, she was posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Barack Obama.
