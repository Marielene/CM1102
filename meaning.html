Also, make sure you customize the Firefox toolbar to include the "developer" item. In the "developer" tool, click on "network" to see the HTTP headers (you may have to reload the page).In general, it is a good idea to test your web pages using http://validator.w3.org

			As for character encodings, please be aware that apart from the "official" code pages, there also exist all kinds of "proprietary" code pages, most notably of Microsoft Windows. The most popular of these is windows-1252 (a.k.a. ANSI). This roughly corresponds to ISO-8859-1 (a.k.a. latin-1) but has additional displayable characters in the range 128-159 (this is where ISO-8859-1 has control characters). Many Windows users are mistakenly specifying ISO-8859-1 whereas they actually mean windows-1252. This has caused browsers to process a website as encoded in windows-1252 whenever ISO-8859-1 is specified.
